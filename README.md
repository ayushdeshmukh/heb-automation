# heb-automation
Automate the searching, shopping, and order of grocery items through HEB Grocery's website.

## Requirements
This project is run on Python 3.7 through [Anaconda's](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual "Anaconda individual download site") Spyder 4 IDE.

## Installation
 The key file needed to run this project is a [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads "Chromedriver download site") file that automates your keystrokes and is compatible with your version of Chrome. Make sure you check the version of Chrome you're using by going to "Chrome Settings" and "About Chrome", then download the file that corresponds to it. Next, use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ "pip installation documentation") to install [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/ "SeleniumHQ Browser Automation") in the command prompt (use Anaconda's native command prompt from the Anaconda launcher if you're using Spyder like I did). 
```bash
pip install selenium
```
From there, you're ready to get started!
